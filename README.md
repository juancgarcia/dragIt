# dragIt
======

jQuery ui widget to add mouse drag adjustment to numeric input fields.

## backStory
======

I was inspired some of Bret Victor's demo's in his talk on "Inventing on Principle,"
where he showed live code editing. In particular I really liked the natural manipulation
of values using sliders and color pickers that magically appear as you mouse over
values in your code.

I had a slider overlay implemented in an earlier version but I didn't like how it worked.
Next step is to try adding that back in.

See it in action on [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jQuery/1.7.1/dependencies/UI/juancgarcia/dragIt/tree/master/jsFiddle/).
